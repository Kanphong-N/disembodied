In order to rename the project, change the java package name from 'com.mygdx.starter' to the desired one. But make sure to do this by using search-replace over the whole project.

Also make sure to edit the paths and references to the old package name in the following files:
core/java/com.mygdx.starter/MyGdxGame.gwt.xml -> <source path="com/mygdx/starter" />
